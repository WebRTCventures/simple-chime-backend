# Simple Amazon Chime SDK Application
## Backend

> Very simple video conference app using AWS Chime.

For setting up, make sure you have **Node 16** and a AWS profile with Chime access configured using your AWS CLI. Then download the dependencies and run the development server with this command:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Now make [the frontend](https://github.com/WebRTCventures/simple-chime-frontend) work too after this.
